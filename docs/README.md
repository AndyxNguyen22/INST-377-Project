Developer Manual

# 1. The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
# 2. They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
# 3. You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.
# 4. Your Developer Manual covers:
#   a. How to install your application and all dependencies
#   b. How to run your application on a server
#   c. How to run any tests you have written for your software
#   d. The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PATCH, etc endpoints, and what they each do
#   e. A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
